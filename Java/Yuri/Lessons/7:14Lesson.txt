7/14 Lesson 


Basic Topics Covered
1. Variables
	a. assigning variables require type, name, and value
		- Example: int a = 4;
	b. Reassigning variales deletes old value

2. Strings
	a. Strings can be added together (concatenated) by using +
		- Example: String a = "hello"+"goodbye";

3. List
	a. declare a list using the type and []
		- Example: int[] list1 = {1,2,3} or String[] stringList = {"hi", "hello", "aloha"}
	b. position or index of list starts at 0
	c. list.length tells you the number of objects in a list

4. For loops
	a. Example Syntax of a for loop: 
		for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
			System.out.println("hello");
		}
	b. 3 parts of for loop
		- initialize variable (int i = 0;)
		- set condition (i < 6)
		- what happens after loop ends (i++)

5. While loops
	a. Syntax for while loop:
		int a = 0;
		while(a < 6)
		{
			System.out.println("Hello");
			a++;
		}
	b. difference between for loop and while loop
		- use for loop when you know the beginning and end to what you are looping for
		- use while loop when you do not know the end of what you are looping

6. Objects and Classes
	- Classes create objects with constructors and methods can be called on an object
	- main method does not create objects but run the program: 
		public static void main(String[] args)
