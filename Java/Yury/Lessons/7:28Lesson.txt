		- when month is guessed correctly, start guessing day
		- when day is guessed correctly, start guessing year
		- count the number of total guesses and tell user when guess is correct

		- 3 instance variables: String ownerName, String color, int numberOfLegs
		- 2 constructors: default constructor, constructor with parameters(name, color, numberOfLegs)
		- 6 methods
			- make get method for all instance variables
			- change the color void method
