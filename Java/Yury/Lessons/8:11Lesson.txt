Inheritance
	- Parent and Child classes
	- Child class is able to use all methods and instance variables from parent class
	- Use extend after delcaring class to make child class of parent class
	- public, private, protected
		- public: anyone can access 
		- private: no one can access 
		- protected: only children of this class can access

Other Object Notes
	- calling methods from Objects vs calling instance variables
		- Object.method()
		- Object.variable
	- creating a new object
		- Object o = new Object() 
		- Object o = new Object(parameterA, parameterB, parameterC)


Connect4 Assignment
	- Create a connect4 game that first prints out the grid of 7 columns and 6 rows 
	- it then asks if two players are ready to play the game. If yes is typed, then starts game. If no is typed, then it ends the game
	- It tells player1 to type in a column number to put a chip in
	- Then after player1 puts in a number from 1-7 (including 7), it creates an "X" on the bottom of the column and reprints the new grid
	- then it is player2 turn and asks for column to choose. Player2 token is marked with an "O". Reprint the grid after every turn
	- The tokens fall to bottom of column but above other tokens already in the column
	- If there are four of the same tokens vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, then the player with the token wins and the game ends as it tells who is the winner

	- Concepts used:
		- System.out.print and System.out.println for printing grid
		- 2D arrays for creating grid and storing chips in different parts of the grid
		- While to keep game running 
		- Scanner input to ask for input
		- If, else, ifelse to check if there are 4 chips in a row
		- if, else to check if there is a chip already in a column and where to place new chip 
		- No Object or Classes have to be used or necessary, it can be created from one main method class
