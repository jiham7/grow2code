Multiple Inheritance (Polymorphism)
	- interfaces: does not have any implementation but only shows headers of what classes should have
	- uses "implements" after class name

Recursion
	- using the same method to call a smaller section of the input
	- Requirements for Recursion
		- base case is required: What input causes the loop to end
		- if it is not the base, how does the function get closer to the base case

To-Dos
	- Start downloading Android studio


HW
- make a method that takes input of a string and returns the reverse of the string 
- Use recursion to create a function that returns the factorial of the input 
	- factorial: https://www.purplemath.com/modules/factorial.htm
- Fibonacci: input is the sequence number and returns value
